# Sprint 3 Review

**Project:** Migrant Hub — student onboarding and blogging platform
**Sprint:** Sprint 3 (17 September – 7 October 2026)
**Date of review:** 7 October 2026
**Present:** Pratham Arora, Yun Wang, Prabhleen Kaur, Sajib Das, Sehwinder Singh

## Sprint goal

Connect the React frontend with the backend API so the app works from start to
finish add working registration and login and deploy the app. The Sprint 1
prototype is our reference.

## What we showed

We showed the working app, not pictures of it. Everyone presented their own part.

- **Home, blog and search.** The posts come from the API. The category buttons
  and the search box really search the database.
- **Register and log in.** You can make an account in the browser. The password
  is saved only as a hash and you stay logged in after a refresh.
- **Write a post.** Only a logged in user can open this page. The author name
  comes from the account, so nobody can write under another name.
- **AI suggestions.** The app sends your draft to Gemini and it suggests a
  category, tags and a short summary. You can change all of them and you can
  still publish when the AI does not answer.
- **Edit and delete.** You can change or delete your own post. Other users do
  not see the buttons and the API says 403 if they try anyway.
- **Must Do and Community.** Both pages read from the API. Every Must Do step
  shows the official link and the date we checked the information.
- **Tests.** 43 tests with Vitest and Supertest. They use a separate database so
  our demo data stays safe.

## Compared with the Sprint 1 prototype

Every screen we drew in Figma now exists and gets its content from our own API.
The two things the prototype said were "concept only" — publishing a post and
the AI teaser - both work now.
